### Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing a personal Spotify listening history dataset to uncover individual music consumption patterns, preferences, and trends over time. Understanding these habits can provide insights into musical taste evolution, preferred listening times, and the influence of factors like shuffle or platform on listening behavior. This analysis can be valuable for personal reflection, or even for developers looking to understand user behavior on streaming platforms.
  
### Executive Summary
**Sales Department:**
This analysis equips the sales team with crucial information on peak sales hours, enabling them to optimize staffing and sales efforts. It also highlights the highest and lowest revenue generated by products across different locations, weeks, months, and seasons, allowing for targeted sales strategies and performance improvements.

**Product Management Department:**
For product management, the analysis offers insights into the average price elasticity of demand for various products, helping them understand how price changes affect sales. It also sheds light on the performance of premium versus budget-friendly products and identifies customer preferences, which can guide product development and portfolio decisions.

**Branch Managers:**
Branch managers can leverage this analysis to understand which products sell most frequently at their specific locations. This information is vital for optimizing inventory management, ensuring popular items are adequately stocked, and potentially identifying local preferences.

**Marketing Team:** 
The marketing team can utilize the findings to strategically plan special promotions based on peak sales periods and customer behavior. It informs decisions on introducing different flavors at various store locations to cater to diverse customer preferences, developing effective combo offers for weekdays or weekends, and tailoring discount strategies to increase customer visits and boost revenue.

### ðŸŽ¯Goal
The objective of this analysis is to:

1. **User Engagement & Listening Behavior.**
  -	What factors influence song skipping behavior?
  - How does shuffle mode impact the way users listen to songs?
  - Which platform (mobile, desktop, web) has the highest user engagement?
  -	What percentage of streams are played in full vs. skipped?
  - How does listening behavior differ by time of day or day of the week?


2. **Content Performance & Trends.**
  - What are the most played and most skipped songs?
  - Which artists and albums have the highest total playtime?
  - Are there specific genres or artists that users skip more frequently?
  - How does a songâ€™s popularity or release year affect skipping rates?
  - Is there a correlation between song duration and completion rates?

3. **Platform & Feature Analysis.**
  -	 Do users listen to music differently on mobile vs. desktop vs. web?
  -	 How does autoplay (songs started without user action) compare to manually selected songs in terms of engagement?
  -	 What is the average play duration per session for different platforms?
  -	 What percentage of users replay the same song multiple times?

4. **Actionable Insights for Spotify.**
 - How can Spotify optimize its recommendation algorithms to improve engagement?
 - Should Spotify promote specific artists, genres, or playlists to reduce skip rates?
 - Can Spotify adjust shuffle mode or autoplay settings to enhance user satisfaction?
 - How do advertisements (if applicable) impact streaming behavior?
 - What strategies can Spotify use to improve retention and engagement among users?
